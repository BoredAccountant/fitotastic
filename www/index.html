				<h3>Friend Stalker</h3>
				<p>
					Do you have a lot of friends on Fitocracy. Do you try to prop and cheer them all, but you find that you can't keep up? Wouldn't it be nice to have one place where you could see what your friends are doing, prop their workouts, badges and quests, and write them notes on their feed or activities? Now, you can!
				</p>
				<h4>Prop</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="img left activity_icons" title=""></span>
					<span class="img prop_all" title=""></span>
					Prop your friends' activities by clicking the activity icon or by clicking the &apos;Prop All&apos; button.
				</p>
				<h4>Friends&apos; Info</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="img user_detail" title="User's bio and post form"></span>
					Hover a friend's profile picture to read their bio, see their level or write a post on their feed. Be inspired by your friends' amazing stories, challenging goals and awesome progress. Leave a timely word of encouragement someone who's struggling or appreciation for their great attitude&mdash;all without leaving the current page!
				</p>
				<h4>Workout Details</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="img left workout_detail" title="Workout details and comment form"></span>
					Hover the workout icons to see points, exercises, and when the workout was logged. What new exercises has a friend tried or what PRs have your friend's achieved? Now you&apos;ll know and can give them a high-five!
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="img no_workouts" title="No workouts in the last 9 days"></span>
					Sometimes a Fito friend will get busy, sick, hurt or discouraged and not log activities for a while. The Friend Stalker will let you know who&apos;s gone more than a week without logging a workout, so you can check in and see how they&apos;re doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="img all_propped" title="You've propped 'em all!"></span>
					If you&apos;re really on top of your game, some of your friends won&apos;t be able to keep up with your propping speed. When you&apos;ve propped all of their activities in the last week, <abbr title="Friend Stalker">FS</abbr> will let you know.
				</p>

				<h3>Top Proppers</h3>
				<p>Wonder who&apos;s giving you all the props? Wonder no more! Top Proppers will grind through your props and see who loves (or bombs) you the most.</p>
